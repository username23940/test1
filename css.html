      <span id='first' class='js'>JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based,
      multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, <span class='js'>JavaScript</span> is one of the three core
      technologies of <span>World Wide Web</span> content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online
      programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without
      the need for <span>plug-ins</span> by means of a built-in <span class='js'>JavaScript</span> engine. Each of the many <span class='js'>JavaScript</span> engines represent a
      different implementation of <span class='js'>JavaScript</span>, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting
      the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
